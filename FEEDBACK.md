<h2>Planning and Presentation</h2>

<p>Excellent work for this project, everyone! You all did an amazing job, especially considering the short amount amount of time you had to work on everything. Your code was very well documented and had plenty of comments explaining each section within the given files. You all put some serious effort into planning this project and it shows with the awesome presentation you made and how you reached MVP so quickly, thus allowing yourselves to add icebox features in the end</p>

<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>
Again, excellent work with this project. In closing, I've placed a few items below I recommend putting some attention on and / or making adjustments to.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>main_app/urls.py - There were a couple "commented out" paths that seemed to map to alternate CBV's</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Main_app/templates - There was a small instance of "commented out" markup and a style tag with some css rules in one of your templates; a better practice would have been to add these rules to a dedicated .css file</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Uniformity in the use of CBV's vs Function Views. Although we showed you both of these in the same app in class, the best convention moving forward is to build your app with 100% CBV's or 100% Function Views. We didn't talk about this, but it's good to know for future projects or if you're ever asked in an interview</p>
    </li>
</ul>
